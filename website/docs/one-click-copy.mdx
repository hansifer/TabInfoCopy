# One-click copy

To allow tabs to be copied with a single click, disable the [popup](./popup/index.mdx) by unchecking [Enable popup](./options.mdx#enable-popup) in options.

With the popup disabled, clicking the extension icon copies tabs immediately using the default tab range and format instead of opening the popup. This may be desirable if you only ever copy tabs using the same range and format.

You can set the range and format defaults used by one-click copy in [options](./options.mdx). The range and format that will be applied are shown when hovering over the extension icon.
