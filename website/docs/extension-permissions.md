# Extension permissions

Tab Copy requests the permissions listed below to function properly. In Google Chrome, you can review these in [Extension settings](./extension-settings.md).

### "Read your browsing history"

This permission allows Tab Copy to get the list of open windows and tabs to copy. It enables Tab Copy to read tab titles, URLs, and a handful of tab-related metadata. It **does not** allow Tab Copy to view the content of web pages you visit or gain insight into how you interact with them.

### "Display notifications"

This is an optional permission that is required by the [**Notify on copy** option](./options.mdx#notify-on-copy). When you turn this option on, your browser may prompt you to grant Tab Copy this permission.

### "Modify data you copy and paste"

This permission allows Tab Copy to write to the clipboard when performing a copy from the context menu or a keyboard shortcut. This permission **does not** allow Tab Copy to read clipboard data.
