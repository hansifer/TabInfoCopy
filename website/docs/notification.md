# Notification

Whenever tabs are copied, the extension icon briefly changes to a ![green checkmark](/img/success.png) to let you know the copy was successful.

If something goes wrong, the icon will flash a ![red x](/img/fail.png). If this happens, refer to our [troubleshooting tips](./troubleshooting/common-issues).

You can also enable toast notifications that provide details about what was copied. To do so, check **Notify on copy** in [Tab Copy options](./options#notify-on-copy).

:::note permissions
Toast notifications require elevated permissions, so the browser may prompt you to grant Tab Copy the ability to show notifications when attempting to enable this option.
