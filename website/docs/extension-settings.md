# Extension settings

Extension settings let you view information about an extension, pin it to the browser toolbar, and allow its use in Incognito mode or with file URLs.

Extension settings for Tab Copy can be accessed by right-clicking the Tab Copy icon ![extension icon](/img/logo-outline-black.png#light-mode-only)![extension icon](/img/logo-outline-white.png#dark-mode-only), then clicking **Manage extension**.

### "Allow in Incognito"

Toggle on **Allow in Incognito** to enable the Tab Copy icon to appear on the toolbar of Incognito windows and to include Incognito tabs when copying.

### "Allow access to file URLs"

Some extensions display an **Allow access to file URLs** toggle. This permission enables viewing local files like PDF's or images in the browser.

Tabs for local files always appear in what's copied, so this permission is not relevant for Tab Copy and therefore does not show up in its extension settings.
