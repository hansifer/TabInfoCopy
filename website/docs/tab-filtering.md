# Tab filtering

Some types of tabs can be excluded from being copied.

To exclude pinned tabs, you can check **Ignore pinned tabs** in [Tab Copy options](./options#ignore-pinned-tabs).

:::note Exceptions
Filtering does not apply when copying **This tab** or **Selected tabs**.
:::

More filtering options may be introduced in the future, including the ability to author [custom filter rules](../roadmap#filter-rules).
