# Development

## The effort

We're passionate about developing software and providing folks with tools that truly make a difference in their daily productivity. Every detail matters, and we put significant thought into each design and development decision we make.

While we love this work, we do it for free in our spare time, and achieving all this goodness with limited resources has its challenges. Developing and maintaining public software at this scale requires a tremendous amount of time and effort because:

- Writing robust and resilient code demands thoughtful design decisions and thorough testing. Tab Copy consists of around **8,000 lines of code**, which gives you some idea of the scope of this effort.

- Keeping up with evolving web platform and browser standards requires ongoing maintenance. Things change, break, and new edge cases emerge. Constant adjustments are part of developing web software.

- With nearly **100,000 users** worldwide, there are always questions, bugs to fix, and feature requests. Satisfying these requests and providing meaningful, timely responses consumes substantial bandwidth.
