# Development

## The effort

We're passionate about developing software and creating tools that make a difference in people's daily productivity. We believe that details matter and put a lot of thought into every design and development decision.

We love this work. So much so that we do it for free in our spare time. But achieving all this goodness with limited resources is challenging because the development and maintenance of software at this scale requires significant time and effort. Some of the reasons why are:

- Creating reliable and user-friendly applications demands careful design decisions and thorough testing. Tab Copy consists of around **10,000 lines of code**, which gives you some idea of the scope of the effort.

- Keeping up with evolving web platform and browser standards requires ongoing maintenance. Things change, break, and new edge cases emerge. Constant adjustments are part of developing software for the web.

- With nearly **100,000 users** worldwide using Tab Copy in many different ways, there are always questions, bugs to fix, and feature requests. Addressing the concerns of our user community promptly and meaningfully takes up a lot of time.
