# Tab Copy Privacy Policy

**Last updated: October 9, 2024**

## Introduction

At Tab Copy, we understand the critical importance of safeguarding our users' data. Every decision we make during development is driven by our commitment to security and data protection. We continuously evaluate our code, architecture, processes, and the systems we rely on to ensure your trust in us is never compromised.

This privacy policy explains what information Tab Copy collects and how it's used, as well as the kind of information we do NOT collect.

## Information We Collect

Tab Copy collects only the minimal information necessary to ensure the app functions as expected and to provide effective support when needed.

### Support Requests

When you contact us for support, we may request specific information to assist with troubleshooting. This could include your Tab Copy settings, custom formats, or copied tabs.

While support correspondence may be archived, any user data provided for troubleshooting is deleted once the issue is resolved. This data is never shared with third parties and is used solely to address your support request.

### Usage Data and Error Logs

Tab Copy tracks high-level usage data, such as how often you copy tabs and the number of tabs copied. This information helps the app determine when to show notifications such as donation requests. All usage data is stored locally on your device and is never sent to any server.

Error logs may also be stored locally when issues occur. We cannot access these logs directly and may ask you to share them to aid in problem resolution.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, or birth dates.

Tab Copy does not transmit or store data to any external services. All copied tabs, settings, and custom formats are stored locally on your device. You can verify this by inspecting the extension's `manifest.json` file, which must declare all permissions and external services required by an extension.

## Extension Permissions

### Permissions Requested by Tab Copy

Tab Copy requests the following permissions to function properly. In Google Chrome, you can review these by navigating to the Extensions page and clicking "Details" on the Tab Copy item.

#### "Read your browsing history"

This permission is what allows Tab Copy to get the list of open windows and tabs to copy. It allows Tab Copy to read tab titles, URLs, and a handful of tab-related metadata. It does NOT allow Tab Copy to view the content of web pages you visit or gain insight into how you interact with them.

#### "Display notifications"

This is an optional permission that is required by the "Notify on copy" option, if enabled.

When you turn this option on, your browser may prompt you to grant Tab Copy permission to show notifications. If you deny this permission, this option will not be turned on.

#### "Modify data you copy and paste"

This permission is what allows Tab Copy to write to the clipboard when performing copy from context menus and keyboard shortcuts. This permission does NOT allow Tab Copy to read clipboard data.

### What Tab Copy Cannot Do

- **Access Web Page Content or Forms**: Tab Copy cannot read the content of web pages or any data you enter into forms. This would require explicit site access permissions, which Tab Copy does not request.
- **Send Data to External Services**: Tab Copy does not send any data to external services or cloud storage.
- **Read Clipboard Data**: Tab Copy cannot read the contents of your system clipboard, as this would require an additional permission.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to Tab Copy's features that affect the transmission, storage, sharing, use, or access of personal data will be outlined in updated versions of this privacy policy. These changes will be communicated to you through Tab Copy's interface or via email if you have opted into notifications.
