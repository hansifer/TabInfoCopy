# v4.1.0

Nov 20, 2024

This release adds a [one-click copy](/docs/one-click-copy) feature and an option to show [tab counts](/docs/options#show-tab-counts) on copy buttons.

## One-click copy

The popup [can now be enabled or disabled](/docs/options#enable-popup) in options.

When disabled, a single click on the Tab Copy extension icon copies tabs immediately using the default tab range and format instead of opening the popup.

Range and format defaults can be configured in [options](/docs/options).

## Tab counts

A new [show tab counts](/docs/options#show-tab-counts) option is now available that allows the number of corresponding tabs to appear on each popup copy button indicating how many tabs will be copied.

## Enhancements

- The duration of the [copy confirmation icon](/docs/notification) has been fixed so it always shows for a consistently appropriate length of time

- Icons linking to docs and the donations page have been added to the popup header. Header icons [can be hidden](/docs/options#show-header-icons) in options.

- Links to docs, the GitHub repo, ratings, and donations have been added to the options page

- An onboarding message has been added for new users with links to the usage guide and options page

- The range "All windows and tabs" has been changed to "All tabs by window" for clarity

- "Copy Buttons" on the options page has been changed to "Ranges" as they now also apply to one-click copy mode
